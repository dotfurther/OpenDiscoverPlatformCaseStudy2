Open Discover Platform:: Incidence Response in Relativity using Relativity Dynamic Object (RDO) as Entity Store

In this case study, we make use of a Relativity Application (RAP) created for dotFurther by cDiscovery. Open Discover Platform (ODP) **
was used to process a small open source data set. While distributed processing of documents, ODP also extracts 350+ entities in addition
to normal eDiscovery content like file identification, extracted text, metadata, binary/content hashing. These extracted
entity types are useful for incident response, data breach, and information governance.  

** ODP automates and distributes processing and it uses the low-level Open Discover SDK for extracting content. For a small overview of 
entity types see:  https://github.com/dotfurther/OpenDiscoverSDK
